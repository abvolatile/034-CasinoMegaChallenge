# 034-CasinoMegaChallenge
DevU Tutorial challenge done during the Tech Academy's C# course.

Purpose - to make a virtual Casino Slot Machine game

GamePlay:
Player enters an amount to bet and presses "Pull Lever!" button
Three random images are generated from an array and a response is displayed
If one or more of the images are cherries, player wins double, triple or quadruple their bet
If all 3 of the images are sevens, player wins 100 times their bet
If one of the images is a bar, player automatically loses (even if the others are cherries)
As player is betting, a total amount available is reduced by the bet amount

I also added a few error messages as well as a page refresh in case total amount reaches zero
